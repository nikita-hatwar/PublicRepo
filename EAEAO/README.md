### Story
Welcome to [mumble mumble mumble] Education Center.  Here you will teach tomorrow's youth how to survive in The Real World - TRW.

### How It Meets the Theme - Education
Ostensibly, Androgynous Bunny Child - ABC - is learning how to platform.
Practically, Bag-on-Head Grown-Up - BHGU - and the player are learning both programming and how to divide a larger puzzle (the level) into discrete and repeatable elements (the teachings).
