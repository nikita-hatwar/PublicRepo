All text at the start of this file is treated as comments.
The format expected for an input text file is as follows:

START DATA (Headers must be written as one word.  Here, in the comments, it is split to avoid detection.)
ROOM NAME
Text To Be Written in the Game
ROOM DESCRIPTION
Text with a triple&&&where there is to be a line break upon display in the game
ROOM EXITS
lowercase direction
Exact Case-Matched Room Name of Destination in that Direction
any more lowercase directions
Same Pattern
ROOM AFFORDANCES
lowercase item or functionality name
any more items or functionality
ROOM NAME
Et cetera
ROOM NAME
Et cetera
END DATA (Again, everything in capital letters is written as one word.)

If a room is empty, there cannot be blank space between ROOM AFFORDANCES and the next ROOM NAME or END DATA footer
Instead there must be "none," "null" (the word written out), or "empty."

Otherwise, the code looks for these headers and ignores some lines of text
Many bits of erroneous text in the middle, such as in ROOM AFFORDANCES, will generate error strings instead
These catch cases of incorrect formating or ordering of information

Comments belong only before the START DATA header or after the END DATA footer

The player begins in the first room listed.

A map must include all five targets noted with special indices:
plotadvancium
pathmaker
furnace
generator
path
Technically, a game can start without these targets, but will not work as normal:
compass
lunch
lever
restfulness
The game cannot start with this target included, as it must come from the generator:
activator

If the room reached by following the True Path is in a normal direction (e.g., "north"),
there must be a duplicate route for that room in the "other" direction or it will not be blocked properly.
