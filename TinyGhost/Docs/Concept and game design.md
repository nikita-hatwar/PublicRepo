# Concept & Game Design

Tiny Ghost is a puzzle platformer that could best be described as a journey through a physics playground. You play the role of a tiny ghost possessing various objects throughout your adventure in order to reach your goal of waking up your body. Over the course of the game, you play as several members of a family, each having lost their body thanks to the antics of an antagonist ghost and his pet ghost cat “Lakittyu”. By changing perspective to a small scale, there are feelings of exploration, surprise, and wonder as ordinary objects become new challenges and present new opportunities.

	Genre: Physics puzzle platformer
	
	Platform:  PC
	
	Target audience: Children 8-12

**Story:**

One day, a curious child touches a strange glowing object hidden in their family's home. The cursed object belongs to a ghost and the touch makes him awaken. Free at last, he lets his ghost cat loose to play with the family, and it knocks the family all out of their bodies. They shrink and shrink, getting weaker, and are forced to haunt their own home or else they will vanish.
    
**Objectives/Player Motivation:**

The task is to get their bodies back under the interference of the antagonist and his pet ghost cat, and the peril of vanishing if ever they cannot find an object to possess within a time limit. In each series of the levels, one member of the family is getting back to his/her own body. At the end, the players can get the antagonist and his pet cat back to their bodies, too.

**Gameplay:**

*Possession Mechanic:* The player character (tiny ghost) can take control of various household objects throughout the level via a possession mechanic. This mechanic allows the player to possess an object via button press, allowing them to perform the object’s characteristic action, as well as to move around in its own distinct way.
   
- *Time limit:* If the ghost is knocked out of its object or decides to un-possess the object via button press, they are faced with a time limit in which they must either possess another object or clear the level – not doing so will result in losing the game.

- *Physics Effects:* Each possessed object will have some action that it may use to interact with the world – a ball may bounce, a pen may shoot forward, etc.

*Victory/Lose Conditions:* The player completes a level by traversing to the end of it. The player loses by either falling out of the level or staying in “ghost mode” beyond the allocated time.

*Checkpoints:* There will be flags throughout the level representing checkpoints in which the player’s progress will be saved.

**Look and feel:**

   Although the game is a story about humans and ghosts, the theme is more about amusement and surprise and is not a horror game. For instance, the antagonist has a pet ghost cat called “Lakittyu”, and this cute creature wants you to keep struggling to the goal. The graphic and sound assets could be a little spooky because what the player controls is a ghost, but they still keep the atmosphere lively to encourage excitement.

**Novelty/“Fun”:**

   Play as a tiny ghost is a different experience because this character can do more magical things than a regular human. Acting as a small creature is amusing, and the intent is that children will find themselves having fun whatever they do: solving puzzles and reaching goals, interacting with objects which have unknown functions, finding hidden stars for achievement or simply messing things up in the level. There is more than one way to find enjoyment in this game.

**User Interface:**
	
Once the game loads, it presents the user a title and standard Game Menu with options: New Game, Load Game, Settings/Controls, Exit. The user can use either the mouse button or the keyboard arrow keys followed by enter to select the options. During gameplay, the user can use the escape key to pause the game and can select either Go Back To Menu or Quit.
	
The game world will be presented to the player in isometric view with a fixed-angle camera that follows the moving character. If and when a level is designed where rotating the camera would be of benefit to the player, this concept may expand, but the angle would remain fixed.

**Key Controls:**

The below are the interactions that the player can have with the game world:

- Movement: Move the tiny ghost character or the objects possessed using keyboard arrows or W-A-S-D keys
- Possession: Possess the nearest possessable object (one that is glowing) using spacebar
- Unpossess: Unposses the host object using spacebar
- Action: Perform the unique action of every possessable object using the Z key, or, practically, any unclaimed key on the keyboard.

If during development it becomes important to allow the player to move up and down while as a tiny ghost, up-and-down movement will use the Q and E keys.
