# Tiny Ghost

# Presented by . . . Tiny Humans

Welcome to our landing page.  We are awesome.  
And today we learned that a double trailing space at the end of a line makes a line break.  
This glorious discovery shall remain here until further notice.

## Mission Statement

Our intent is to create a physics puzzle platformer designed to invoke surprise and discovery, by expanding our knowledge of Unity and Git.
