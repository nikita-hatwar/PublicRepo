# Sprint 3 retrospective

We have now begun actual production and put together essential code so that we all can use our individual expertise.  At this point, the notes from our end-of-sprint were pretty much about those tasks.

Things that went well included the critical Unity training for the team members who were previously unfamiliar with it.  We found time to go over basics together, and, thereafter, were able to take advantage of training in another course without losing too much team time.  In general, we finished what we set out for ourselves at the last retrospective, including reorganizing to go from Google Drive (where we have first drafts) to GitHub Projects for almost everything, and then adding more detail in our breakdown of Project issue cards.

We have decided on tackling:

Individual "empirical coding," or having all team members just go ahead and start coding anything and everything that we can think to do.  We have decided on and implemented the structure of the central code, and now just about everything is ready for refinement and advancing, such as improving movement, adding features, adding assets, and so on.  Because we have finally gotten past our bottleneck in the basic setup and training, team members who are still learning Unity can "learn while doing."  Because we are all dedicated to the same overall plan for the project, team members who are more experienced can jump ahead and contribute at any level.
