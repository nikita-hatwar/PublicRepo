## Projects for the Online Portfolio of Richard S. Hetley

I created this public repository while pursuing an M.S. in Game Design & Development at Rochester Institute of Technology.  Course projects, both individual and group, have involved use of C# and Unity to create videogames of differing levels of complexity.  Files in this repository are considered finished and playable.

### Tiny Ghost MVI Version (/TinyGhost)

A team effort to prototype a videogame using agile development with Scrum.  The plan for this semester is to create a single level of a 3-D physics puzzle platformer aimed to an audience of children ages 8-12.  This folder contains the production documentation (including market research) for the project as well as a Windows executable for the "minimum viable interaction" demo.  (WASD/Q/E to move, ctrl to possess/unpossess objects, shift to force unpossess, space to perform object action.)

### Excessively Acronymed Educational Adventure (Obviously) (/EAEAO)

Team submission for Jam for a Cause 2019, a 24-hour game jam at RIT.  The theme was "education."  We collaborated on game design and then launched into learning 2-D Unity.  I designed the levels, including some that remain in the project assets unconnected to main play.  For further information and game controls, see its readme on this portfolio.

### Predictable Cave Adventure (/DataDrivenCave)

I coded three versions of this text adventure, which is one more than the assignment required: a first pass which told a single complete story, a second "enhanced" version with puzzle mechanics, and a final "data-driven" version refactoring the original to incorporate a data-driven approach.  This final version has 42 rooms (the data-driven element), an expanded puzzle, an in-game help system, and an implied story hiding behind the game world.
