## Projects for the Online Portfolio of Richard S. Hetley

I created this public repository while pursuing an M.S. in Game Design & Development at RIT.  Course projects, both individual and group, have involved use of C# and Unity to create videogames of differing levels of complexity.  Files in this repository are considered finished and playable.

### Predictable Cave Adventure (/DataDrivenCave)

I coded three versions of this text adventure, which is one more than the assignment required: a first pass which told a single complete story, a second "enhanced" version with puzzle mechanics, and a final "data-driven" version refactoring the original to incorporate a data-driven approach.  This final version has 42 rooms (the data-driven element), an expanded puzzle, an in-game help system, and an implied story hiding behind the game world.

### Tiny Ghost (coming when finished)

A team effort to prototype a videogame using agile development with Scrum.  The plan for this semester is to create a single level of a 3-D physics puzzle platformer aimed to an audience of children ages 8-12.
