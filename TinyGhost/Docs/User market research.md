## Age-appropriate media

We looked at recommendation lists and articles on gaming trends as sources of information on what interests our target audience (8-12 year old children).  We found the following:

_ALSC reading list_ - http://www.ala.org/alsc/publications-resources/book-lists/2019-summer-reading-list
(we consulted the suggested 3-5th grade reading list)

_Digital trends games list_ - http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/best-video-games-for-kids-sorted-by-age-group
(we consulted age categories 5+ and 10+)

_Internet Matters kids tech trends_ - http://www.internetmatters.org/hub/expert-opinion/kids-tech-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2018
(we consulted the gaming subcategory)

_Super Awesome kids trend predictions_ - https://www.superawesome.com/2018/11/30/the-biggest-kids-trends-for-2019
(we consulted the gaming subcategory)

In the first source, commonly, the recommended children's books have a grand theme matched to a relatable theme.\
There is usually a fantastical element involved.  It may be a “magical solution to all problems,” but often is more a well-integrated hook that is practical (and just happens to be appealing ‘cause it’s magic).\
Some material seems shallow on these lists, but complexity and gravity are also the norm: disasters with family and so on.\
We also checked the 6-8th grade reading list and found more gruesome recommendations than we were expecting, likely too much for our general age range.

In the second source, almost every recommended videogame emphasizes co-op play or interaction with the rest of the household.\
Though puzzles are basically everywhere, their recommendations starting at 10+ include greater precision movement in 3-D space.

The final two sources talk about existing and predicted trends in gaming, addressing the “why” of each more than just the games themselves.  Both cite the use of a game as a playground: being able to imagine, create, or quite literally dance, allowing for play activities that are more appealing to children than just pursuing goals.

## Child psychology and development

As matches the age-appropriate game recommendations, children aged 8-12 are at a point where they can handle increasing precision in gameplay.  Typically, they are beyond the point of being frustrated with games that require complexity, but are still learning.

Additionally, as matches both game and literary recommendations, such children are capable mentally of handling more complex themes.  This has its limits: very abstract concepts, and “black box” puzzles, may be beyond them.

In conclusion: Even if some abstraction in the plot were okay, it is clear that more immediately-engaging content is desirable.  Even if “I just want to play” weren’t a valid goal on its own, having opportunities for imaginative play with direct results is desirable.

## History

We compare our game to others in 2-D and 3-D platforming.  It is easy to find examples of platformers: the original Mario still spawns new versions and editions, and not only do new competitors arise regularly but they often have a similar focus on colorful visuals and child-friendly themes.  For example, 2-D platformers in this pattern include Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams released in 2012 and Macrotis: A Mother's Journey released in 2019, and 3-D platformers include Sonic Generations in 2011, PAC-MAN and the Ghostly Adventures in 2013, and Skylar & Plux: Adventure On Clover Island in 2017.

The familiar properties (e.g., PAC-MAN) are certainly child-friendly, in part because this was the target audience for quite long.  However, even things with more cerebral content such as Psychonauts in 2005 still were extremely colorful.  Beyond visuals, it appears to be important that such games allow for interesting means of interaction to solve the platforming challenges: the Kirby series in general has allowed for tremendous variety in interaction, and recent releases such as Unravel Two in 2018 fundamentally depend on the physics.

## Our conclusions and our niche

Our game, Tiny Ghost, will meet the needs of the target audience with its playful content and fantastical hook.  The ability to use that fantasy to have an effect on the world (possessing objects to solve puzzles) should appeal, as is the playground-like aspect where players can enjoy themselves simply by causing physics effects.

Thematically, we incorporate the idea of family in that the player is trying to get family members (as tiny ghosts) back into their body.  Our antagonist is to be a human ghost paired with his own “family,” a cat ghost.  The player can save the antagonist in the end, but moreso having both the cat and the antagonist allows for a more complex scene emphasizing family and a personal connection.

We are leaving open the possibility of a second player, as playing with one’s real family to save one’s virtual family is itself a hook.

Tiny Ghost will fit into the market in similar places to Kirby and Mario games, in the sense of exploration with a goal.  Though, by referencing the Mario series, we emphasize this would not be similar to Super Mario Odyssey: the key in Super Mario Odyssey is exploration of space, whereas in our game it is exploration of interaction or physics.  As such, Tiny Ghost would be more similar to Unravel Two or other mechanic-heavy games, such as Kirby games: Kirby games involve exploring the possibilities of interacting with the environment, adopting new powers regularly through a level.

Tiny Ghost adds to this formula in two ways.  First is our implementation of many physics interactions from many possessable objects, which turns levels into physics playgrounds.  Second is how Tiny Ghost is a more personal experience; one where family connection and relatable characters take it above a simple platforming game.
